# Dog-Breed-Classification-PyTorch

## Project Description
This is Dog Breed Classification app which takes an input image and either identifies the breed of a detected dog or identifies that the image is of a human and assigns a dog breed that resembles him/her
If the input image is identified neither as a human or a dog the ouput indicates the same

## Software and Libraries used
This project uses PyTorch and Transfer Learning to detect dogs and identify dog breeds and haarcascades from OpenCV to detect human faces.
The pre trained models used are VGG16, RESNET18 and RESNET50

### Libraries
The project uses the following python libaries
- opencv-python
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- torch
- torchvision
- Pillow
- numpy
- os
- typing
- glob

## Additional Files
The test_images folder should be downloaded to view the test results of the finished model
